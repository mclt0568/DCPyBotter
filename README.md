## On The Technical Side

### Little Disclaimer
This is my **first time** using git properly. This is my **first** .net GUI which I coded properly. This is my **first** project using OOP. This is my **first** time coding in C#. I have never learnt Programming properly in a college yet. I'm just a 16 guy. So if you think that my code is a little weird. Please don't mind. If it's a bad practice of coding, create an issue with `codeisbad` label or other tags.
### Downloading and Opening The Code
Just clone the whole thing and open discordpybots.sln with Visual Studio. Choosing Build Solution option from the Build menu should compile it, no additional things needed.

### Contributing
Contributing is not opened until I figure out how exactly GitHub works (´・ω・).
